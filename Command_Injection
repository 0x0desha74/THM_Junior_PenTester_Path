What is command injection?
	- is the abuse of an application's behaviour to execute commands on the operating system, using the same privileges that the application on a device is running with.
	- also knows as RCE(Remote Code Execution ) as you can  execute commande over the OS.

Discovering Command Injection:
	- This vulnerability exists because applications often use functions in programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJS to pass data to and to make system calls on the machine’s operating system. For example, taking input from a field and searching for an entry into a file.

# Types Of Command Injection:
	1. Blind command injection  => This vulnerability exists because applications often use functions in programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJS to pass data to and to make system calls on the machine’s operating system. For example, taking input from a field and searching for an entry into a file.
	
	2. Verbose command injection => This type of injection is where there is direct feedback from the application once you have tested a payload. For example, running the whoami command to see what user the application is running under. The web application will output the username on the page directly.

# Detecting The Blind command injection:
	- in blind command injection there is no output of your injected paylaod, so we need some commands that casue a time delay, so we can use `ping` or `sleep`
	- or we can user the > operator by execute whoami command and  redirect the output in an file using > then we can cat this file content.

# Detecting Verbose commamd injection:
	- is much easier than blind cause you can see the output of your payload.


# Remediation
	- In PHP there are manu function that interact with the shell like:
	- limitation the user input using some patterns 
	- Sanetising user input by accepting only numerrical or only urls and so on, also removing or escaping special characters like < , &, /,>
	-Bypassing Filters => like strip qoutes we can bypass this using hexadicimal.
