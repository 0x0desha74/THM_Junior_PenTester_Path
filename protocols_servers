[] Telnet:
	- Is an applcatioon layer protocol used to control a system remotly, telnet is not secure as the dattat transferd in plaintext,
[] POP3:
	- Post Office Protovol Version 3 is used to download email messages from Mail Delivary Agent(MDA) server
	- POP3 runs in port 110

[] IMAP:
	- Internet Message Access Protocol
	- Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients). In other words, if you mark an email message as read when checking your email on your smartphone, the change will be saved on the IMAP server (MDA) and replicated on your laptop when you synchronize your inbox.Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3.

	- IMAP sends the credentials 
 in port 23
	- To connect to a host using Telnet::
				`telnet <host_ip>` then enter the username and the password

[] HTTP:
	- HyperText Transfer Protocol used to trnsfer the web pages by connecting to the web server and requesting the HTML files from it iin clearText so it is not secure
	- You can use tools like telnet or Netcat to act as a web browser and retrives web pages from the web server, but the browser do it for you.
	- There are three popular webServers:
		1.Apache
		2.IIS => Internet Informetion Server
		3.nginx

[] FTP:
	- File Transfer Protocol is developed to make transfer files between different computers efficient, FTP
[] POP3:
	- Post Office Protovol Version 3 is used to download email messages from Mail Delivary Agent(MDA) server

	- IMAP sends the credentials 
 in port 21
	- FTP has two Modes:
		1.Active: In the active mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from the FTP server’s port 20.
		2.Passive: In the passive mode, the data is sent over a separate channel originating from an FTP client’s port above port number 1023.
		- TYPE A command to switch the file transfer mode to ASCCI
		- TYPE I command to switch the file transfer moded to Binary
		- FTP is not secure as in transfers data in clear Text
	-FTP servers and FTP clients use the FTP protocol. There are various FTP server software that you can select from if you want to host your FTP file server. Examples of FTP server software include:
			1.vsftpd
			2.ProFTPD
			3.uFTP

[] SMTP:
	- Simple Message Transfer Protocol
	-Email is one of the most used services on the Internet. There are various configurations for email servers; for instance, you may set up an email system to allow local users to exchange emails with each other with no access to the Internet. However, we will consider the more general setup where different email servers connect over the Internet.

Email delivery over the Internet requires the following components:

    Mail Submission Agent (MSA)
    Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)
    Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
    Mail User Agent (MUA)

	- The figure shows the following five steps that an email needs to go through to reach the recipient’s inbox:

    1.A Mail User Agent (MUA), or simply an email client, has an email message to be sent. The MUA connects to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to send its message.
    2.The MSA receives the message, checks for any errors before transferring it to the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) server, commonly hosted on the same server.
    3.The MTA will send the email message to the MTA of the recipient. The MTA can also function as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
    4.A typical setup would have the MTA server also functioning as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
    5.The recipient will collect its email from the MDA using their email client.

 	- SMTP runs on port 25

[] POP3:
	- Post Office Protovol Version 3 is used to download email messages from Mail Delivary Agent(MDA) server
	- POP3 runs in port 110
