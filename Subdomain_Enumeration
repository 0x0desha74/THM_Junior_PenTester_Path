- Subdomain Enumeration => The proccess of finding valid subdomains of a domain to expand our attack surface.
- Three ways for doing subdomains enumeration:
	1. OSINT
		- SSL/TLS Certificate
			When an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificate is created for a domain by a CA (Certificate Authority), CA's take part in what's called "Certificate Transparency (CT) logs". These are publicly accessible logs of every SSL/TLS certificate created for a domain name. 
			you can use:
				`cert.sh`
				`https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui`
		- Search Engines
			using google dorks like "site:*.example.com -site:www.example.com" => returun subdomains contaning "example.com" but will exclude "www.example.com" 
		- Using Tools
			sublist3r => `sublist3r -d target.com`
			subfinder => `subfinder -d target.com`
			assetfinder => `assetfinder --subs-only target.com`
			amass
			findomain => `findomain -t target.com`
			Turbolist3r 
			
	2. Brute Forcing
		- fuzzing domain name using some tool like dnsrecon
			`dnsrecon -t brt -d domain.com`
	3. Virtual Hosts
		- Some subdomains aren't always hosted in publically accessible DNS results, such as development versions of a web application or administration portals. Instead, the DNS record could be kept on a private DNS server or recorded on the developer's machines in their /etc/hosts file (or c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file for Windows users) which maps domain names to IP addresses. 
			`ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" http://server_ip`  you can filte the output using -fs {size}
