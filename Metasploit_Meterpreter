[] Meterpreter => is a metaslpoit paylaod allows you to have a CLI interact with the target system, and it has its own commands.
[] How does Meterpreter Work?
	- Meterpreter runs on the target system but it is not installed on it "do not write itself in the hard disk as a file such <meterpreter.exe>", meterpreter runs on the RAM as a proccess, to avoid being detected by the anti-virues
	- Meterpreter also aims to avoid being detcted by the IDS and IPS using encrypted communications, so if the IPS and the IDS doesn't decrypt and inspect the traffi, the meterpreter will not be detected.
	- Meterpreter write itself in a spoofed name in the task manager, you can know its PID(process ID), and search for it to know its spoofed name
[] Your decision on which version of meterpreter to use will mostly based on:
	1. The target OS 
	2. The compponents available (python?, web run using PHP?)
	3. Network connection types you can have with the target system (Do they allow raw TCP connections? Can you only have an HTTPS reverse connection? Are IPv6 addresses not as closely monitored as IPv4 addresses? etc.) 
[] Meterpreter Commands:
	Meterpreter commands
Core commands will be helpful to navigate and interact with the target system. Below are some of the most commonly used. Remember to check all available commands running the help command once a Meterpreter session has started.


- Core commands

    background: Backgrounds the current session
    exit: Terminate the Meterpreter session
    guid: Get the session GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
    help: Displays the help menu
    info: Displays information about a Post module
    irb: Opens an interactive Ruby shell on the current session
    load: Loads one or more Meterpreter extensions
    migrate: Allows you to migrate Meterpreter to another process
    run: Executes a Meterpreter script or Post module
    sessions: Quickly switch to another session

- File system commands

    cd: Will change directory
    ls: Will list files in the current directory (dir will also work)
    pwd: Prints the current working directory
    edit: will allow you to edit a file
    cat: Will show the contents of a file to the screen
    rm: Will delete the specified file
    search: Will search for files
    upload: Will upload a file or directory
    download: Will download a file or directory

- Networking commands

    arp: Displays the host ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache
    ifconfig: Displays network interfaces available on the target system
    netstat: Displays the network connections
    portfwd: Forwards a local port to a remote service
    route: Allows you to view and modify the routing table

- System commands

    clearev: Clears the event logs
    execute: Executes a command
    getpid: Shows the current process identifier
    getuid: Shows the user that Meterpreter is running as
    kill: Terminates a process
    pkill: Terminates processes by name
    ps: Lists running processes
    reboot: Reboots the remote computer
    shell: Drops into a system command shell
    shutdown: Shuts down the remote computer
    sysinfo: Gets information about the remote system, such as OS

- Others Commands (these will be listed under different menu categories in the help menu)

    idletime: Returns the number of seconds the remote user has been idle
    keyscan_dump: Dumps the keystroke buffer
    keyscan_start: Starts capturing keystrokes
    keyscan_stop: Stops capturing keystrokes
    screenshare: Allows you to watch the remote user's desktop in real time
    screenshot: Grabs a screenshot of the interactive desktop
    record_mic: Records audio from the default microphone for X seconds
    webcam_chat: Starts a video chat
    webcam_list: Lists webcams
    webcam_snap: Takes a snapshot from the specified webcam
    webcam_stream: Plays a video stream from the specified webcam
    getsystem: Attempts to elevate your privilege to that of local system
    hashdump: Dumps the contents of the SAM database

[] Post-Exploitation:
	- Migrate:
		Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. For example, if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the keyscan_start, keyscan_stop, and keyscan_dump command options to make Meterpreter act like a keylogger. Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.

	- hashdump
		The hashdump command will list the content of the SAM database. The SAM (Security Account Manager) database stores user's passwords on Windows systems. These passwords are stored in the NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) format.
	- Search

		The search command is useful to locate files with potentially juicy 
		information.

	- Shell

		The shell command will launch a regular command-line shell on the target system. Pressing CTRL+Z will help you go back to the Meterpreter shell.
