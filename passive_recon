- Reconniassance => The process of gathring information about the target.
- Passive & Active recon:
	passive recon => gathring information  without any interacting with the target, using public resources 

- Passive recon activites like:
	- reading jop description
	-  look up the DNS recordes of the target from public DNS server

- Active recon => gathering information with innteracinng with the target
- avtive recon examples:
	- Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.
	- connectig with the target server 
	- socail engineering
	- ping the target to chekh the ICMP service is blocked or not

--HOW TO DO PASSIVE RECON--
1.whois => whois records are used to collect various information about the target domain such as:
	- Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
	- Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)
	- Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
	- Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?

- How to use whois?
	--using terminal => `whois tryhackme.com`
	-- or using websites like => `https://whois.domaintools.com/`
								 `https://whois.com`
								 `https://whois.is`


2. nslookup	

--records types--
	- A =>  IPv4
	- AAAA => IPv6
	- CNAME  => alias name
	- MX  => mail server
	- SoA => stores important information about a domain or zone such as the email address of the administrator, when the domain was last updated, and how long the server should wait between refreshes.
	- TXT 
- How to use nslookup?
	`nslookup -type=option target.com` SERVER

- optionn can be any of the records type above
- SERVER  => the  public DNS server you want to dig at, 
 google dns servers  8.8.8.8  & 8.8.4.4 
 cloudflare dns servers 1.1.1.1 & 1.0.0.1
 you can find more public dns servers here =>  `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dns`

 3. dig => Domain Information Groper
 	`dig @server target TYPE`

 4. DNSDumpster => the same as whois and nslookup but organised, and gives subdomains `dnsdumpster.com`

 5. shodn.io  => Shodan.io tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected “things” in contrast with a search engine for web pages. Once it gets a response, it collects all the information related to the service and saves it in the database to make it searchable. Consider the saved record of one of tryhackme.com’s servers.
