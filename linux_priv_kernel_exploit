[] The kernel is what manage the communications between the hardware components and the applications, so it needs higher priveleges.
[] so we can exploit the kernel to have higher priveleges
[] it's easy
    1. enumerate for the kernel version
    2. search for a code exploit for this version
    3. run the exploit
- and remember any mistake in kernel exploitatio can lead to system crush
{} search resources => `https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves`
{} or you can use linux exploit suggester, but it may give false positive (report a kkenel vulnerabiliti that does not  affect the target system), false negative(report nothing although the kernel is vulnerable)

{} to run c lang file

 gcc ofs.c -o ofs
 ./ofs
