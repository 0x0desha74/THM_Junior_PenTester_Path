[] Introduction To Vulnerabilities::
	- Vuknerability => In cyber security is define as a weekness in the design, flaw or the behaviour of the system or the application
	- Vulns can orginate from poor design of the system or an oversight of the  intended actions from the user

	- we can say that there  are five categories of vulnerabilities:
			1. Operating System
				These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.
			2. (Mis)Configuration-based
				These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.
			3. Weak or Default Credentials
				Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
			4. Application Logic
				These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
			5. Human-Factor
				Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.

	- CVSS => Common Vulnerability Scoring System

	- Vunlrability Severty
	
		Rating		Score
		None		0
		Low			0.1 - 3.9
		Medium		4.0 - 6.9
		High		7.0 - 8.9
		Critical	9.0 - 10.0

	- VPR => Vulnerability Priority Rating

		Rating		Score
		Low			0.1 - 3.9
		Medium		4.0 - 6.9
		High		7.0 - 8.9
		Critical	9.0 - 10.

[] Vulnerability Databases:
	1. NVD => National Vulnerability Database `https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing`
		-  The National Vulnerability Database is a website that lists all publically categorised vulnerabilities. In cybersecurity, vulnerabilities are classified under “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures” (Or CVE for short). 
		- These CVEs have the formatting of `CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER`. For example, the vulnerability that the famous malware WannaCry used was CVE-2017-0144.

	2. Exploit-Db => `https://www.exploit-db.com/`
		-Exploit-DB is a resource that we, as hackers, will find much more helpful during an assessment. Exploit-DB retains exploits for software and applications stored under the name, author and version of the software or application.


	# We sould know some terminologies:
		1.Vulnerability => A vulnerability is defined as a weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviours of a system or application.
		2.Exploit  =>	An exploit is something such as an action or behaviour that utilises a vulnerability on a system or application.
		3.Proof of Concept (PoC) =>	A PoC is a technique or tool that often demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability. 

 [] An Example of Finding a Vulnerability:
 	- After knowing the version of the serevice running we can search for an exploitt in the Exploit-DB by its version such as
 		- apache tomcat 9.0.17 => go and type in the search bar `tomcat 9.0` you will get exploits for this version of apache web server.
