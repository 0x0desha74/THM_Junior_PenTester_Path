[] you can think of it asm the reverse process of SUID
	- in SUID the admin give a regular user the permission to use a service
	- but in capabilites, the admin make the binary be executed for a reguler user rather than give the user a root privelege over it

[] to check => 
		1. `getcap / -r 2>/dev/null`
		2. use https://gtfobins.github.io 
		3. enjoy hacking :)
