[] Automated Vs. Manulal Vuln Research:
	- Automated Scanner such as Nessus, Metasploit, and more
	- The advantages and dis advantages of using an vuln scanner

		Advantages:
			1.Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.
			2.These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.
			3.Open-source solutions exist.
			4.Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for.
		Disadvantages:
			1.People can often become reliant on these tools.
			2.They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes.
			3.Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.
			4.They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.

[] Finding Manual Exploits:
	1. rapid7 data base is a vulns database and also exlpois database, is also give instructions to how to exploit using tools like Metasploit
	2. GitHub:
		- You can fine tools exploits and more useful staff for you as a security researcher

		- GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload – there is no formal verification process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that said, there is also a downside in that PoC’s may not work where little to no support will be provided.
	3. searchsploit:
		- Is CLI tool and offline version of Expliot-DB, you can saerch using it by the application name `searchsploit wordpress`, or using the vulnerability type.

[] Example Of Manual Exlpoitation:
	- foothold => gaining access to the vulnerable machine's terminal
	- Before we start, it is important to note that exploits rarely come out of the box and are ready to be used. They often require some configuration before they will work for our environment or target. The level of configuration will vary upon the exploit, so you will often find multiple exploits for the same vulnerability on an application. It is up to you to figure out which exploit is the most appropriate or useful to you.


[] Summary:
	- how to find manual exploits. there are multiple tools:

		2. GitHub repos
