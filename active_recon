Active recon  => begin with a direct connection with the target machine, it can be a phone call, a visit to the target campany, or a direct connnectiion with the target system using tools such ping, nc, traceroute & telnet.
- the recon is called to be active when an innformation is shown in the logs contain the attacker IP, time/duratioin of the connection and more

- Web browser can be used in active recon, using developer tools and some add-ons like:
	1. foxyproxy => switching the proxy easily with one click
	2. wappalyzer => provids insights about the technologies the website uses
	3. user-agent switcher and manager => spoofing user-agent header in the request , you can chooes the OS and theuser-agent you want

- ping => in general ping is used to check the connecivity between you and a remote system,

		but we can also use ping in active recon to check if the remote system is online or not.
- how ping works?
	. when you CLI this `ping tryhackme.com` pind sends an ICMP echo packet to the remote system and if system reply with an ICMP echo reply, assuming the service is not blocked in both the sender and the remote server by the firewall.
- how to use ping?
	in linux => `ping -c 10 tryhackme.com` => -c 10 to send only 10 packets
	in win => `ping -n 10 tryhackme.com` => -n 10 to send only 10 packets
	the default num of IICMP packets send in win is 4 while in linux is infinite (you must stop it if not previously specified)

- the reason why i got `Destination Host Unreachable` can be:
	1. the target system is unplugged to the network, or your system
	2. there is a faulty network device across the path
	3. firewall blocked such packets
	4. the target server is turned off orr still booting or crashed !

Notes:
ttl in linux => 128
ttl in win => 64


- traceroute => command traces the route taken by the packet from your system to the target system, it gives you the IP address of the routers or hops the packet takes while being sent.

- how ro use traceroute?
	in linux => `traceroute tryhakme.com`
	in windows => `tracert tryhakme.com`

- how traceroute works?
	there is no direct way to discover the pass the packet takes to travel from your system to the target system, but we can use the ICMP protocole to trick the routers into revealing their IP addresses, we can do this by settting a small Time To Live TTL in the IP header.
- how TTL works?
	TTL => the maximum number of routers or hops the packet can passes before being droped,
	when sending the packet, their ttl will be 64, each time the packet passes trough a rrouter or hop the ttl decreases by 1 till it reaches ttl=0 then it will be back the the original router (the sender)


-telnet => Teletype Network, is a protocole developed in 1969 to communicat with a remote system using CLI, BTW telnet sends all data includes usernames 7 passwords in palintext so it is in secure way to send a data, the alteranitive is SSH (Secure Shell)
the default port for telnet is 23 and for SSH is 22

- how to use telnet?
	if you realise that port 23 is open in a target machine you can have full access on it using this command `telnet target_ip 23`
	if you wanna connect to a web server on port 80 using telnet:
		1. `telnet web_server_ip 80`
		2. to view the root directory send a GET request `GET / HTTP/1.1`
		3. send `host: telnet` due to the request to be send 

-Netcat/nc=> it can be a client that connect to a listening port or can act as a server that listening on a port of your choice.
	it supports TCP & UDP

- how nc works?
	1. as a client => you can connect to a server on a specific port using the command `nc server_ip 80` in this case it will connect using HTTP
	after that you can send a basic GET request like `GET / HTTP/1.1 host: netcat` to dump the root pageg content.
	2. as a server => you can listen to a specific port using `nc -nlvp 80` 
		-n => numeric only, no resolution of hostname via DNS
		-l => listen mode
		-v => verebose
		-p => the port number
		-vv => very verbose
		-k => keep listening after the cliend disconnects

Notes:
	1. the port number must come after -p
	2. ports less than 1024 requires root privileges
	3. -n avoid dns lookup and warning
