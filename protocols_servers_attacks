[] Sniffing Attacks:
	- refers to using a network packets capture tool to collect data about the target if the data is transmitted in cleartext you will know ins content

	- Sniffing Tools::
		1. tcpdump => is a free open source CLI tool
		2. wireshark => is a free open source  GUI tool
		3. tshark => CLI alternate to wireshark

	- to do a sniffing attack you must be in the same network as the target, or  applying a MITM attack then sniff the data you want

[] MITM:
	- Man-In-The-Middle => This attack is relatively simple to carry out if the two parties do not confirm the authenticity and integrity of each message. In some cases, the chosen protocol does not provide secure authentication or integrity checking; moreover, some protocols have inherent insecurities that make them susceptible to this kind of attack.

	- Any time you browse over HTTP, you are susceptible to a MITM attack, and the scary thing is that you cannot recognize it. Many tools would aid you in carrying out such an attack, such as Ettercap and Bettercap.

[] SSL/TLS:
	- The protocols we talk about so far run in the application layer, and are in cleartext, we can add encryptioon to the prrotocls via the presentation layer.
	- TLS is more secure than SSl

Protocol 	Default Port 	Secured Protocol 	Default Port with TLS
HTTP 	    80 	            HTTPS 				443
FTP 	    21 	            FTPS 				990
SMTP 	    25 	            SMTPS 				465
POP3 	    110 			POP3S 				995
IMAP 	    143 			IMAPS 				993


	- Lets have a look to the HTTP/HTTPS ptorocol and how the browser retrrive a wb page from the server

	- HTTP
		1. Establish TCP connection
		2. Send HTTP requests to retrieve the page
	- HTTPS:
		1. Establish TCP connection
		2.Establish SSl/TLS connection
		3. Send HTTP requests to retrieve the page using HTTP methods such GET & POST

	-To establish an SSL/TLS connection, the client needs to perform the proper handshake with the server. Based on RFC 6101, the SSL connection establishment will look like the figure below.

[] SSH
	- Secure Shell is a safe alternate of Telnet as the data teansfered over it is encrypted, was developed to provide a secure way for remote system administration
	- SSH uses port 22
	- SCP => Secure Copy Protocol is used to transferr files safly, this SCP is based on SSH Protocol `scp mark@10.10.186.241:/home/mark/archive.tar.gz ~`
	- FTP + SSL/TLS => FTPS
	- FTP + SSH => SFTP

[] Password Attacks:
	- Attacks against passwords are usually carried out by:

    	1. Password Guessing: Guessing a password requires some knowledge of the target, such as their petâ€™s name and birth year.
    	2. Dictionary Attack: This approach expands on password guessing and attempts to include all valid words in a dictionary or a wordlist.
    	3. Brute Force Attack: This attack is the most exhaustive and time-consuming where an attacker can go as far as trying all possible character combinations, which grows fast (exponential growth with the number of characters).


    - Dictionary attcks can be carried out using tools like Hydra 
    	`hydra -l username -P wordlist server service`

    	-l username => the username you want to launch the attack against
    	servere => the hostname or the host IP
    	service => the service you want to launch the attack against
    	-s Port => to define non-default port for the service
    	-V & -VV => forr verbose
    	-t n => number of parallel connection hydra will used in the same time
    	-d for dedbugging details


[] Summary:
	
	-Hydra Options

	Option 	Explanation
-l username => 	Provide the login name
-P WordList.txt => 	Specify the password list to use
server service => 	Set the server address and service to attack
-s PORT => 	Use in case of non-default service port number
-V or -vV =>	Show the username and password combinations being tried
-d 	Display => debugging output if the verbose output is not helping

	- Comman protocols and its dedfault port befor TLS and after

Protocol 	Default Port 	Secured Protocol 	Default Port with TLS
HTTP 	    80 	            HTTPS 				443
FTP 	    21 	            FTPS 				990
SMTP 	    25 	            SMTPS 				465
POP3 	    110 			POP3S 				995
IMAP 	    143 			IMAPS 				993
