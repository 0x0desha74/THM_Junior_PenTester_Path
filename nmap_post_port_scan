[] Service detection:
	- adding -sV, make nmap to search deeper to determine the services run on the open porprtrrs and thier versions.
	- you can control the intensity of the scan using --version-intensity <level>, nmap has 10 levels from 0-9.
	-sV --version-light => intensity of 2
	-sV --version-all => intensityy of 9
	-note that when using -sV, nmap must complete the 3-way handshake with the target and establish a fully TCP connecttion so the default port scan -sS (SYN scan ) cannot be used
	- note that, assume port 22 is open, nmap will guess that ssh service is running on that port.
	- in contrast the service version is not guessed cause the nmap connects to the prot to detect its service verrion.

[] OS detection:
	- you can porform an OS detection usinn -O => `nmap -sS -O <target_ip>`
	- note that nmap guess the OS type correctly but the veriosn is not always accurate
[] Traceroute::
	- To perform a tracroute using nmap => nmap --traceroute <target_ip>

[] Nmap Script Engin (NSE):
	- A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language. 

	- To use default scripts => -sC = --script=default

	- You can also specify the script by name using --script "SCRIPT-NAME" or a pattern such as --script "ftp*", which would include ftp-brute. If you are unsure what a script does, you can open the script file with a text reader, such as less, or a text editor. In the case of ftp-brute, it states: “Performs brute force password auditing against FTP servers.” You have to be careful as some scripts are pretty intrusive. Moreover, some scripts might be for a specific server and, if chosen at random, will waste your time with no benefit.


[] Saving The Output:
	- Whenever you run a Nmap scan, it is only reasonable to save the results in a file. Selecting and adopting a good naming convention for your filenames is also crucial. The number of files can quickly grow and hinder your ability to find a previous scan result. The three main formats are:

   1.Normal
   2.Grepable (grepable)
   3.XML

There is a fourth one that we cannot recommend:

   4.Script Kiddie
- Normal => -oN <filename> => like the terminal

- Grepable => The grepable format has its name from the command grep; grep stands for Global Regular Expression Printer. In simple terms, it makes filtering the scan output for specific keywords or terms efficient. You can save the scan result in grepable format using -oG FILENAME. The scan output, displayed above in normal format, is shown in the console below using grepable format. The normal output is 21 lines; however, the grepable output is only 4 lines. The main reason is that Nmap wants to make each line meaningful and complete when the user applies grep. As a result, in grepable output, the lines are so long and are not convenient to read compared to normal output.

- XML => The third format is XML. You can save the scan results in XML format using -oX FILENAME. The XML format would be most convenient to process the output in other programs. Conveniently enough, you can save the scan output in all three formats using -oA FILENAME to combine -oN, -oG, and -oX for normal, grepable, and XML. 

- Script Kiddie => A fourth format is script kiddie. You can see that this format is useless if you want to search the output for any interesting keywords or keep the results for future reference. However, you can use it to save the output of the scan nmap -sS 127.0.0.1 -oS FILENAME, display the output filename, and look 31337 in front of friends who are not tech-savvy.


Option 	Meaning
-sV determine service/version info on open ports
-sV --version-light 	try the most likely probes (2)
-sV --version-all 	try all available probes (9)
-O 	detect OS
--traceroute 	run traceroute to target
--script=SCRIPTS 	Nmap scripts to run
-sC or --script=default 	run default scripts
-A 	equivalent to -sV -O -sC --traceroute
-oN 	save output in normal format
-oG 	save output in grepable format
-oX 	save output in XML format
-oA 	save output in normal, XML and Grepable formats
