[] Metasploit is a widly used framewark for exploitation porpuses, but it is also used in Information gathering, Scanning, Exploitation, PreExploitation and more

[] Metasploit components:
	1. msfconsole => cli user interface
	2. modules => exploit, scanner and payload modules and more
	3. tools =>  msfvenom, pattern_create, pattern_offset and more

[] console will be you main component which enables you interact with the different modules.
[] Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.


[] Metaslpoit commands
 -  You can override any set parameter using the set command again with a different value. You can also clear any parameter value using the unset command or clear all set parameters with the unset all command. 
 - You can use the setg command to set values that will be used for all modules. The setg command is used like the set command. The difference is that if you use the set command to set a value using a module and you switch to another module, you will need to set the value again. The setg command allows you to set the value so it can be used by default across different modules. You can clear any value set with setg using unsetg. 
 - The exploit -z command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens.
 - You can use the background command to background the session prompt and go back to the msfconsole prompt.
 -  Alternatively, CTRL+Z can be used to background sessions.
 - The sessions command can be used from the msfconsole prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.
 - To interact with any session, you can use the sessions -i command followed by the desired session number.
